# Context

A personal app for keeping notes, todos and the day's appointments in one place, with a desktop app and a
scriptable command-line tool, `context`.

## Command line

`context help` lists every command. Results go to stdout, errors to stderr as one line. Exit codes: 0 success,
1 error, 2 usage error.

### Subpages

A note can have subpages: the children of `Meetings.md` are the `.md` files in the `Meetings/` folder next to it, to
any depth. A subpage's name is its path with `/` on every OS, so `notes` lists `Meetings/Meeting 1` right after
`Meetings`, and `note show`, `links` and `export` take that name (quote it when it has spaces):

```sh
context note show "Meetings/Meeting 1"
```

The name is only matched against the note list, never used as a file path. `import` and `capture` write top-level
notes only; subpages are created, moved and deleted in the desktop app.

### People

Write `@[Anna Schmidt]` in a note to mention a person (at the start of a line or after a space; not in code).
`context people` lists everyone mentioned, with the number of notes that mention them. `context person Anna Schmidt`
(or `context person "@[Anna Schmidt]"`) lists those notes, then the appointments whose title or location mentions
the person or that list them as an attendee, latest first. Appointments come from `calendar/*.ics` and the last
downloaded copy of the Exchange calendar; nothing is downloaded. In the desktop app, clicking a mention opens the
person's page `people/Anna Schmidt`, creating it (and `people`) on that click if needed.

### Attributes and page types

Give any page attributes with plain lines that start with a key, then `::`, then the value:

```markdown
# Anna Schmidt

affiliation:: [[ACME]]
role:: Bereichsleiter
```

A key starts with a letter (then letters, digits, `-`, `_`; at most 50) and is matched ignoring case; the line must
start at the beginning (no indent, not in code). A line with no value, such as `role::`, is a placeholder and finds
nothing. A value that is one `[[link]]` is also a note link, so `ACME` lists Anna under `linked from`.
`context find role Bereichsleiter` prints the names of the notes with that attribute, one per line (none: no output);
values match ignoring case, and `[[ACME]]`, `ACME` and `acme` are the same value.

A page's types are its `type::` lines (`type:: organization`); a page under `people` without one is a `person`.
`context find type person` lists them. `context types` prints each type with its attributes (`person` comes with
`affiliation` and `role`, `organization` with none). Define your own type as a subpage of a top-level note `types`,
for example `types/project` with the lines `attribute:: owner` and `attribute:: due`; a `types/person` page replaces
the built-in one. A new person page made by clicking a mention starts with one empty line per `person` attribute.
In the desktop app, `/find role Bereichsleiter` in the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K) lists the same notes.

### JSON output

Add `--json` to a read command (`version`, `todos`, `notes`, `note show`, `tags`, `links`, `people`, `person`,
`find`, `types`, `current`) to get one
JSON object on one line instead of text. Property names are fixed camelCase; missing values are `null`; dates are
`yyyy-MM-dd` and times ISO 8601 with offset. Errors stay one text line on stderr with the same exit codes, and
write commands and `help` refuse the flag.
Non-ASCII text and characters such as `+`, `&`, `'` and `<` are written as `\uXXXX` escapes, so the output is
plain ASCII; any JSON parser, `ConvertFrom-Json` included, reads them back.

| Command | Shape |
|---------|-------|
| `version` | `{"version":"1.2.3"}` |
| `todos` | `{"todos":[{"due":"2026-11-14","text":"..."}]}` |
| `notes` | `{"notes":[{"name":"A","locked":false}]}` |
| `note show <name>` | `{"name":"A","text":"..."}` |
| `tags` | `{"tags":[{"tag":"work","count":2}]}` |
| `tags <tag>` | `{"tag":"work","notes":["A"]}` |
| `links <note>` | `{"note":"A","links":[{"note":"B","direction":"to","missing":false,"sharedTags":["work"]}]}` |
| `people` | `{"people":[{"person":"Anna Schmidt","count":2}]}` |
| `person <name>` | `{"person":"Anna Schmidt","notes":["A"],"appointments":[{"start":"...","end":"...","allDay":false,"title":"...","location":null}]}` |
| `find <key> <value>` | `{"key":"role","value":"Bereichsleiter","notes":["people/Anna Schmidt"]}` |
| `types` | `{"types":[{"type":"organization","attributes":[]},{"type":"person","attributes":["affiliation","role"]}]}` |
| `current` | `{"today":"...","appointments":[...],"calendar":{...},"due":[...],"linkedNotes":[...]}` |

PowerShell examples:

```powershell
# Todos due this week (due is ISO yyyy-MM-dd, which the [datetime] cast reads the same in every culture)
$todos = (context todos --json | ConvertFrom-Json).todos
$todos | Where-Object { [datetime]$_.due -le (Get-Date).AddDays(7) } | ForEach-Object { "$($_.due) $($_.text)" }

# Notes you can read here (not sensitive)
(context notes --json | ConvertFrom-Json).notes | Where-Object { -not $_.locked } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty name

# Today's appointments as start and title
$current = context current --json | ConvertFrom-Json
$current.appointments | ForEach-Object { "$($_.start) $($_.title)" }
if ($null -eq $current.due) { Write-Warning 'todos.json could not be read' }

# The text of one note
(context note show Plan --json | ConvertFrom-Json).text

# Everyone at ACME
(context find affiliation ACME --json | ConvertFrom-Json).notes
```

`current` writes its document even when part of the data can't be read: then it exits 1, its error lines are on
stderr, and `due` or `linkedNotes` is `null`.
